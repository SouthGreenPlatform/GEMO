# GeMo - A mosaic genome painting tool for plant genomes

GeMo is a WebApp to represent **Genome Mosaics** with current focus on plants. However, GeMo is developed in a generic way it can be also applied to other organisms.

## Main features 

1. Chromosome painting visualisation

Linear chromosome representation based on [ideogram](https://github.com/eweitz/ideogram).
Support for polyploidy
Work with preloaded datasets or direct input trhough interface

2. Data curation of mosaic prediction

3. Plot genes on mosaic karyotypes

4. Data and high quality image export

## Documentation

The full documentation is available [here](https://gemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Live demo
Gemo is currently running at the [Banana Genome Hub](https://banana-tools-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/gemo/) where anyone can upload its own data or test with pre-loaded datasets.
