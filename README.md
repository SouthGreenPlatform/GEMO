# GeMo - Genome Mosaics visulaisation tool

GeMo is a WebApp to respresent **Genome Mosaics** with current focus on plants. However, GeMo is developed in a generic way it can be also applied to other organisms.


## Live demo
Gemo is currently running at the [Banana Genome Hub](https://banana-tools-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/gemo/) where anyone can upload its own data or test with pre-loaded datasets.

## Main features 

### Ideogram visualisation

Chromosome representation has been developed on the top of [ideogram](https://github.com/eweitz/ideogram).

### Polyploidy

*Coming soon*

### ancestral pool customization

*Coming soon*


## Data inputs (*Coming soon*)

It accepts two types of files:

- Genomic block: 
- Normalized curve:

See the Wiki for full documentation.


## Tutorials

In order to generate ready to use datasets, analyses can be conducted with the following software

### VCFHunter

VCFHunter is a suite of [python scripts](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/VcfHunter) enabling chromosome painting of indivisual based on the contribution of ancestral groups using VCF files.

Please look at the [tutorial](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/VcfHunter/blob/master/turorial_painting_GEMO_visualization.md)

### TraceAncestor

Please look at the [tutorial](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/TraceAncestor2)  (*Coming soon*)

GeMo has been developed in the framework of the [Genome Harvest project](https://www.genomeharvest.fr) supported by the Agropolis fondation.
