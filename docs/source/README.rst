GeMo is a WebApp to represent Genome Mosaics with current focus on plants. However, GeMo is developed in a generic way it can be also applied to other organisms.


GeMo requires two types of datasets to generate the ideogram visualization:
 - the chromosome names and their respective sizes.
 - the position of the mosaic blocks along the chromosomes

Live demo
---------

GeMo is currently running at the `Banana Genome
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hub <https://banana-tools-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/gemo/>`__ where
anyone can upload its own data or test with pre-loaded mosaics/datasets.


Main features
-------------

1. Dynamic chromosome painting visualisation

2. Online Data curation of mosaic prediction

3. Markers or Genes Plots on mosaic karyotypes

4. Data and high quality image export


Data inputs (*Coming soon*)
---------------------------

It accepts two types of files:

-  Genomic blocks:

-  Normalized curves:

See the Wiki for full documentation.

Generating datasets
-------------------

In order to generate ready-to-use datasets, analyses can be conducted
with the following software:

VCFHunter
~~~~~~~~~

VCFHunter is a suite of `python
scripts <https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/VcfHunter>`__ enabling
chromosome painting of individual based on the contribution of ancestral
groups using VCF files.

Please look at the `tutorial <VCFHunter.md>`__

The public version of GeMo contains a series of mosaics for pre-loaded genomes resulting from published studies (Ahmed et al. 2019, Baurens et al., 2019, Cenci et al, 2020, Martin et al. 2020) that were conducted in Banana and Citrus for subsets of genotypes . When selecting a pre-loaded entry, the form is automatically filled with the raw data and the visualization parameters.
