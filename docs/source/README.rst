GeMo is a WebApp to represent Genome Mosaics with current focus on plants. However, GeMo is developed in a generic way it can be also applied to other organisms.


Main features
=============

1. Dynamic chromosome painting visualisation

2. Online Data curation of mosaic prediction

3. Markers or Genes Plots on mosaic karyotypes

4. Data and high quality image export


Data inputs
===========

GeMo requires two types of datasets to generate the ideogram visualization

1. The chromosome names and their respective sizes
2. The position of the mosaic blocks along the chromosomes. It accepts two types of files:

   * Genomic blocks:
   * Normalized curves:


Live demo
=========

GeMo is currently running at the `Banana Genome Hub <https://banana-tools-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/gemo/>`__ where
anyone can upload its own data or test with pre-loaded mosaics/datasets.
